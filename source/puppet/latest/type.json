Resources can be limited to a schedule by using the\n[`schedule`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/metaparameter.html#schedule)\nmetaparameter.\n\nCurrently, **schedules can only be used to stop a resource from being\napplied;** they cannot cause a resource to be applied when it otherwise\nwouldn't be, and they cannot accurately specify a time when a resource\nshould run.\n\nEvery time Puppet applies its configuration, it will apply the\nset of resources whose schedule does not eliminate them from\nrunning right then, but there is currently no system in place to\nguarantee that a given resource runs at a given time.  If you\nspecify a very  restrictive schedule and Puppet happens to run at a\ntime within that schedule, then the resources will get applied;\notherwise, that work may never get done.\n\nThus, it is advisable to use wider scheduling (for example, over a couple\nof hours) combined with periods and repetitions.  For instance, if you\nwanted to restrict certain resources to only running once, between\nthe hours of two and 4 AM, then you would use this schedule:\n\n    schedule { 'maint':\n      range  => '2 - 4',\n      period => daily,\n      repeat => 1,\n    }\n\nWith this schedule, the first time that Puppet runs between 2 and 4 AM,\nall resources with this schedule will get applied, but they won't\nget applied again between 2 and 4 because they will have already\nrun once that day, and they won't get applied outside that schedule\nbecause they will be outside the scheduled range.\n\nPuppet automatically creates a schedule for each of the valid periods\nwith the same name as that period (such as hourly and daily).\nAdditionally, a schedule named `puppet` is created and used as the\ndefault, with the following attributes:\n\n    schedule { 'puppet':\n      period => hourly,\n      repeat => 2,\n    }\n\nThis will cause resources to be applied every 30 minutes by default.","attributes":{"name":{"description":"The name of the schedule.

Take this schedule:\n\n    schedule { 'veryoften':\n      period => hourly,\n      repeat => 6,\n    }\n\nThis can cause Puppet to apply that resource up to every 10 minutes.\n\nAt the moment, Puppet cannot guarantee that level of repetition; that\nis, the resource can applied _up to_ every 10 minutes, but internal\nfactors might prevent it from actually running that often (for instance,\nif a Puppet run is still in progress when the next run is scheduled to\nstart, that next run will be suppressed).\n\nSee the `periodmatch` attribute for tuning whether to match\ntimes by their distance apart or by their specific value.\n\nValid values are `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `never`.","kind":"parameter","namevar":false},"repeat":{"description":"How often a given resource may be applied in this schedule's `period`.\nMust be an integer.","kind":"parameter","namevar":false},"weekday":{"description":"The days of the week in which the schedule should be valid.\nYou may specify the full day name 'Tuesday', the three character\nabbreviation 'Tue', or a number (as a string or as an integer) corresponding to the day of the\nweek where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, and so on. Multiple days can be specified\nas an array. If not specified, the day of the week will not be\nconsidered in the schedule.\n\nIf you are also using a range match that spans across midnight\nthen this parameter will match the day that it was at the start\nof the range, not necessarily the day that it is when it matches.\nFor example, consider this schedule:\n\n    schedule { 'maintenance_window':\n      range   => '22:00 - 04:00',\n      weekday => 'Saturday',\n    }\n\nThis will match at 11 PM on Saturday and 2 AM on Sunday, but not\nat 2 AM on Saturday.","kind":"parameter","namevar":false}},"features":{},"providers":{}},"tidy":{"description":"Remove unwanted files based on specific criteria.

(For example, `apt-get update`.)\n* The exec has an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` attribute, which prevents\n  Puppet from running the command unless some condition is met.\n* The exec has `refreshonly => true`, which only allows Puppet to run the\n  command when some other resource is changed. (See the notes on refreshing\n  below.)\n\nA caution: There's a widespread tendency to use collections of execs to\nmanage resources that aren't covered by an existing resource type. This\nworks fine for simple tasks, but once your exec pile gets complex enough\nthat you really have to think to understand what's happening, you should\nconsider developing a custom resource type instead, as it will be much\nmore predictable and maintainable.\n\n**Refresh:** `exec` resources can respond to refresh events (via\n`notify`, `subscribe`, or the `~>` arrow). The refresh behavior of execs\nis non-standard, and can be affected by the `refresh` and\n`refreshonly` attributes:\n\n* If `refreshonly` is set to true, the exec will _only_ run when it receives an\n  event. This is the most reliable way to use refresh with execs.\n* If the exec already would have run and receives an event, it will run its\n  command **up to two times.** (If an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` condition\n  is no longer met after the first run, the second run will not occur.)\n* If the exec already would have run, has a `refresh` command, and receives an\n  event, it will run its normal command, then run its `refresh` command\n  (as long as any `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` conditions are still met\n  after the normal command finishes).\n* If the exec would **not** have run (due to an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates`\n  attribute) and receives an event, it still will not run.\n* If the exec has `noop => true`, would otherwise have run, and receives\n  an event from a non-noop resource, it will run once (or run its `refresh`\n  command instead, if it has one).\n\nIn short: If there's a possibility of your exec receiving refresh events,\nit becomes doubly important to make sure the run conditions are restricted.\n\n**Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing an exec's cwd or the executable\nfile used in an exec's command, the exec resource will autorequire those\nfiles.

The Win32 APIs define exit codes as 32-bit unsigned integers, but\nboth the cmd.exe shell and the .NET runtime cast them to signed\nintegers. This means some tools will report negative numbers for exit\ncodes above 2147483647.
